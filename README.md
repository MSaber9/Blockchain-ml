Combining Blockchain and Machine Learning for Fraud Detection.
In this project that I have developed myself using Python, I demonstrate how an XGBoosted K-means algorithm can be combined with a simple blockchain in order to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions. 
The intended use case for this project is in the Banking Sector.
